printrbot-mods
==============

My modifications on the original Printrbot Plus.

1. Quick-Fit X-Carriage with larger space for the extruder (especially for my Budaschnozzle hotend but can hold 4 hotends) derived from [thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27617). Special thanks to [RichRap](http://richrap.blogspot.com/) for the [original idea](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19590),
2. Quick-Fit Extruder derived from [Greg's Hinged Accessible Extruder with New Motor Mount](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27887) that fits the printrbot original ubis hotend,
3. Fanduct adapter for [this one on thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29985),
4. Push-Fit (M6 thread enabled) compatible extruder idler,
5. 20cm x 21cm borosicate glass (from [lulzbot.com](http://lulzbot.com)) holder,
6. Printrbot Plus nut keeper, derived from [this](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30160) and [available on thingiverse too](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30830),
7. Z-stop dial with knurled top,
8. Y-Axis bearing guide compatible with original Printrbot Y-Axis stabilizer [derived from thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29985),
9. Push-fit filament guide for Printrbot Super-Z,
10. Wades extruder bowden setup adaptor for Printrbot Super-Z,
11. Quick-Fit Ubis Hotend Push-fit bowden adaptor,
12. Polakium Engineering X-Axis for Printrbot LC and Plus support for the part #10.

All the Push-fit fits 6mm OD tubing (PTFE is better) and has a M6 thread at one side. I usually drill them with 3.5mm bit. I also drill a chamfer using a 4mm bit and a 5mm bit.
